Effectively, she is a machine. Just a machine. Caleb in college did a semester on AI theory and there was a thought-experiment they gave them. Its called Mary in the black and white room.

Then one day - someone opens the door. And Mary walks out. She sees a blue sky. And at that moment, she learns something that all her studies could never tell her. She learns what it feels like to see color. An experience that can not be taught, or conveyed. The thought experiment was to show the students the difference between a computer and a human mind.
